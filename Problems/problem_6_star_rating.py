"""
Fill out the star_rating function that takes an integer from 0 to 5.
It returns a string with 5 stars, with that number of them are filled in.

The 'assert' function will make the program fail if False is passed in.
It can be used for easy testing, but libraries like unittest and pytest
are more useful and have more features.
